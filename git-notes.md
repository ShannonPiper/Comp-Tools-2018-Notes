Commit your changes before pulling and pull often.
Git pull with pull and try to merge conflicts.
Git fetch will pull changes, but not try to merge them, just show them.
Merge push is when you eventually merge two versions of a file with 
conflict.
Git will try to merge versions if possible, but will have you manually 
merge if the changes made by two people are close together.
